To control X-Ray Sampling Strategy provide a bean of type `com.amazonaws.xray.strategy.sampling.SamplingStrategy`

Micronaut X-Ray module ships with built-in support for loading sampling rules from a JSON Document. For example:

[source,yaml]
.src/test/resources/application.yml
----
tracing:
    xray:
        sampling-rule: 'classpath:sampling-rules.json'
----

and include a Sampling Rules JSON Document in your classpath:

[source,json]
.src/test/resources/sampling-rules.json
----
include::aws-xray/src/test/resources/sampling-rules.json[]
----
