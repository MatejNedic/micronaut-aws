The HttpServer filter uses provided https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/javax/servlet/AWSXRayServletFilter.html[AWSXRayServletFilter]. Read more about provided filter at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-java-filters.html[Tracing incoming requests with the X-Ray SDK for Java].

The filter creates new segment that name resolves in this order:

1. Bean of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/strategy/SegmentNamingStrategy.html[SegmentNamingStrategy] type.
2. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/strategy/FixedSegmentNamingStrategy.html[FixedSegmentNamingStrategy] configured by `tracing.xray.segment-name` property.
3. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/strategy/FixedSegmentNamingStrategy.html[FixedSegmentNamingStrategy] configured by `micronaut.application.name` property.
4. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/strategy/FixedSegmentNamingStrategy.html[FixedSegmentNamingStrategy] with default of `micronaut.xray-http-filter`.

Note that all incoming requests are traced and new https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/entities/Segment.html[Segment] is created.

To disable tracing of incoming requests set `tracing.aws.server-filter` to `false`.
