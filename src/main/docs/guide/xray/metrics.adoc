You can use publish unsampled https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-java-monitoring.html[Amazon CloudWatch metrics from your collected X-Ray segments].

Start by adding dependency:
dependency:aws-xray-recorder-sdk-metrics[groupId="com.amazonaws"]

Depedency contains https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/metrics/MetricsSegmentListener.html[MetricsSegmentListener] that will be automatically configured to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-java/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/xray/AWSXRayRecorder.html[AWSXRayRecorder].

Note you can disable `MetricSegmentListener` automatic configuration by:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]

aws:
  xray:
    cloudwatch:
      enabled: false
